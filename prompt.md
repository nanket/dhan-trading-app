I am a option buyer i want to automate my trades instead of mannually taking trades 
here is my strategy first of 
1. I will check whether nifty is bullish or bearish. By checking  closing is high or low from previous day if its low then its bearish if its high or low is not broken then its bulish
2. On chart I have plotted gann levels the lines on that you see on teal colors are gann level i have use gann calculator for plotting. eg:
if nifty open up open 24371 the above gann level is on 24375 if nifty croses that its means its in bullish territory and below gann level is 24336  if it crosses that which means it sin bearish territory
3. Next step is will check for OI CHANGE range oi for eg if nifty opens up 24371 and it is in bullish territory i will check 24400 both PUT and CE and check the range oi 24300 - 24350 - 24400 if both are bullish that is PE > CE than i take the trade the difference should be atleast greater and 5 lakhs between both PE and CE than it gives confidence to buy 

for now create a seperate section for this also for now send telegram alerts only later on we can implement autotrade also calculte the accurate gann
